            <h1>Backtracking</h1>
            <p>Copyright Â©2002 by David Matuszek</p>
            <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
            <p>The usual <em>scenario</em> is that you are faced with a number of <i>options</i>, and you must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if you didn't, it isn't.</p>
            <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the <strong>tree</strong> probably has some good <b>leaves</b> and some bad leaves, though it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.</p>
           <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can <ins>backtrack</ins> to continue the search for a <del>good</del>  leaf by <strike>revoking your most recent choice, and </strike> trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>
           <p>This needs an example.</p>

           <ol>
            <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A</li>
            <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
            <li> C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
                <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
                <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
                <li> A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
                <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)</p>

                <h1>The backtracking algorithm.</h1>
                <p>Here is the algorithm (in pseudocode) for doing backtracking from a given node n:</p>
                <pre>boolean solve(Node n) {
                    if n is a leaf node {
                        if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                        else return false
                    } else {
                        for each child c of n {
                            if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                        }
                        return false
                    }
                }</pre>
                <p>Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the problem.</p>
                <p>When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal node.</p>
                <p>Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node at the current level, or storing it in an array.</p>
                 <p>Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:</p>  
                 <pre>boolean solve(Node n) {
                    if n is a leaf node {
                        if the leaf is a goal node {
                           print n
                           return true
                        }
                        else return false
                    } else {
                        for each child c of n {
                            if solve(c) succeeds {
                                print n
                                return true
                            }
                        }
                        return false
                    }
                }</pre> 
                <h1>Keeping backtracking simple</h1>   
                <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex: for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate solutions.</p>      
                <p>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test whether a node is a leaf by writing a <strong>gameOver</strong> method (or you could even call it isLeaf). This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.</p>
                <p>Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying <strong>for each child c of n</strong>. In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which ones you've already examined?</p> 
                <h2>Example: TreeSearch</h2>
                <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.<br><br>

                    A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child. All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree.</p>
                  
                <center><img src="treesearch.gif"></center>
                <pre>
                    Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:

                    public class BinaryTree {
                        BinaryTree leftChild = null;
                        BinaryTree rightChild = null;
                        boolean isGoalNode = false;
                        String name;
                        
                        BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) {
                            this.name = name;
                            leftChild = left;
                            rightChild = right;
                            this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
                        }
                    }
                    Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which constructs the above binary tree.
                    
                    static BinaryTree makeTree() {
                        BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, f;
                        c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false);
                        d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false);
                        e = new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true);
                        f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false);
                        a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false);
                        b = new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false);
                        root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false);
                        return root;
                    }
                    Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:
                    
                    public static void main(String args[]) {
                        BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
                        System.out.println(solvable(tree));
                    }
                    And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.
